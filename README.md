# Vendor Performance & Inventory Optimization Analytics

This project analyzes retail vendor performance and inventory efficiency using real-world multi-table data (purchases, sales, inventory, vendor invoices, and price lists). The goal is to help a retail/wholesale business identify top and underperforming vendors, optimize pricing and promotions, and reduce capital locked in slow-moving inventory.

The end-to-end pipeline includes:
- Ingesting raw CSV data into a SQLite database using Python and logging
- Designing a vendor–brand–store–month analytical model table with SQL joins
- Engineering key business metrics such as gross profit, margin %, inventory turnover, unsold capital, and bulk purchase discounts
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical tests to answer business questions
- Building a Power BI dashboard for executives to monitor vendor performance and make data-driven decisions

This repository is structured and documented as a portfolio-quality, industry-style analytics project that I can walk through in interviews.
